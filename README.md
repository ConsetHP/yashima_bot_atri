## Special thanks

- [NoneBot](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2) : multi-platform chatbot framework
- [NoneBot-Plugin-MCQQ](https://github.com/17TheWord/nonebot-plugin-mcqq) : migrated mc-qq chat synchronizing features from it because it uses [`Nonebot Plugin
SAA`](https://github.com/MountainDash/nonebot-plugin-send-anything-anywhere) which doesn't support send messages to onebot v11 qq-guild
- [Bison](https://github.com/MountainDash/nonebot-bison) : migrated website subscribting features from it due to the same reason mentioned above
